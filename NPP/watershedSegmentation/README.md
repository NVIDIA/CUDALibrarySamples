# Watershed Image Segmentation with NPP

## Overview

This project demonstrates grayscale image segmentation using the watershed algorithm implemented through NVIDIAâ€™s NPP library. The technique is based on the GPU-accelerated approach detailed in the paper:

> "Efficient 2D and 3D Watershed on Graphics Processing Unit: Block-Asynchronous Approaches Based on Cellular Automata" by Pablo Quesada-Barriuso et al.

## Key Concepts

## Build Instructions

### Linux
```bash
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
```

### Windows
```bash
$ mkdir build
