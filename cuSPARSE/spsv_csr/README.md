# cuSPARSE Generic APIs - `cusparseSpSV CSR`

## Description

This sample demonstrates the usage of `cusparseSpSV` for performing *sparse triangular solver with single right-hand side*, where the sparse matrix is represented in CSR (Compressed Sparse Row) storage format. The solver is configured with `CUSPARSE_FILL_MODE_LOWER` for the fill mode, indicating that only the lower triangular part of the matrix is used, and `CUSPARSE_DIAG_TYPE_NON_UNIT` for the diagonal type.

`op(A) * X = alpha * Y`, where `X` is the output dense vector and `op(Y)` is the input dense vector (RHS).

## Building

* Command line
    ```bash
    nvcc -I<cuda_toolkit_path>/include spsv_csr_example.c -o spsv_csr_example -lcusparse
    ```

* Linux
    ```bash
    make
    ```

* Windows/Linux
    ```bash
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make
    ```
    On Windows, instead of running the last build step, open the Visual Studio Solution that was created and build.
