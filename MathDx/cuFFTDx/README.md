# cuFFTDx Library - API Examples

All example, including more advanced onces, are shipped within [cuFFTDx package](https://developer.nvidia.com/cufftdx-downloads).

## Description

This folder demonstrates cuFFTDx APIs usage.

* [cuFFTDx download page](https://developer.nvidia.com/cufftdx-downloads)
* [cuFFTDx API documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cufftdx/index.html)

## Requirements

* [cuFFTDx/MathDx package](https://developer.nvidia.com/cufftdx-downloads)
* [See cuFFTDx requirements](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cufftdx/requirements_func.html)
* CMake 3.18 or newer
* Linux system with installed NVIDIA drivers
* NVIDIA GPU of Volta (SM70) or newer architecture

## Build

* You may specify `CUFFTDX_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES` to limit CUDA architectures used for compilation (see [CMake:CUDA_ARCHITECTURES](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/prop_tgt/CUDA_ARCHITECTURES.html#prop_tgt:CUDA_ARCHITECTURES))
* `mathdx_ROOT` - path to mathDx package (XX.Y - version of the package)

```
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -DCUFFTDX_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES=70-real -Dmathdx_ROOT=/opt/nvidia/mathdx/XX.Y ..
make
// Run
ctest
```
