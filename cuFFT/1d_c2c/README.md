# cuFFT 1D FFT C2C example

## Description

In this example a one-dimensional complex-to-complex transform is applied to the input data. Afterwards an inverse transform is performed on the computed frequency domain representation.

## Supported SM Architectures

All GPUs supported by CUDA Toolkit (https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus)  

## Supported OSes

Linux  
Windows

## Supported CPU Architecture

x86_64  
ppc64le  
arm64-sbsa

## CUDA APIs involved
- [cufftExecC2C API](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cufft/index.html#function-cufftexecc2c-cufftexecz2z)


# Building (make)

# Prerequisites
- A Linux/Windows system with recent NVIDIA drivers.
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/download) version 3.18 minimum

## Build command on Linux
```
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
```
Make sure that CMake finds expected CUDA Toolkit. If that is not the case you can add argument `-DCMAKE_CUDA_COMPILER=/path/to/cuda/bin/nvcc` to cmake command.

# Usage 1
```
$  ./bin/1d_c2c_example
```
