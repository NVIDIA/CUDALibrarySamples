* Linux system with installed NVIDIA drivers
* NVIDIA GPU of Volta (SM70) or newer architecture

## Build
Download and expand the cuPQC SDK then use the MakeFile located in this directory. Make sure that you set the `CUPQC_DIR` to the location of your expanded cuPQC SDK folder.

```
export CUPQC_DIR=<your_path_to_cupqc>
make
// Run
./example_ml_kem
./example_ml_dsa
./example_sha2
./example_sha3
```

## Examples
There is a ML-KEM and a ML-DSA example in this directory, these demonstrate the usage for the cuPQC library, and requires `libcupqc.a`. 
There are also SHA2 and SHA3 examples that demonstrate the usage of the cuHash library, these require `libcuhash.a`. 
For the detailed descriptions of the examples please visit [Examples](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cupqc/examples.html) section of the cuCPQ documentation.
