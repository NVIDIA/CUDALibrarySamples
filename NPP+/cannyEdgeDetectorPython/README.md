# Canny Edge Detection with NPP+ in Python

This sample demonstrates how to use the nppiFilterCannyBorder_8u_C1R_Ctx function from NVIDIA's NPP+ (NVIDIA Performance Primitives) for Canny edge detection. The function requires a single-channel 8-bit grayscale image as input. Color images should be converted using nppiColorToGray() or nppiRGBToGray() prior to processing.

The project compares performance between NPP+ and OpenCV implementations of Canny edge detection across various resolutions, focusing on execution time and scalability, particularly when using PyTorch tensors on the GPU.


## Canny Edge Detection Benchmark: OpenCV vs NVIDIA NPP+

This benchmark evaluates the performance of Canny edge detection using two implementations:

- **OpenCV**: CPU-based with GPU-CPU-GPU data transfer overhead
- **NVIDIA NPP+ (v0.10.0)**: GPU-accelerated, integrated with PyTorch tensors for optimized in-GPU processing

The benchmark is tailored for high-resolution image analysis (up to 5K) and aims to assess execution time and scalability.

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

NPP+ provides substantial speedups over OpenCV for Canny edge detection, particularly for high-resolution images where memory transfers become a bottleneck. By combining NPP+ with PyTorch tensors, real-time or large-scale image processing pipelines can benefit from minimal latency and higher throughput.

For high-resolution vision applications (e.g., 4K+), NPP+ is the preferred method.
