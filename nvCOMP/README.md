# nvCOMP Library API examples and benchmarks

## Introduction

nvCOMP is a CUDA library that features generic compression interfaces to enable developers to use high-performance GPU compressors and decompressors in their applications. Example benchmarking results and a brief description of each algorithm are available on the [nvCOMP Developer Page](https://developer.nvidia.com/nvcomp).

This folder demonstrates the nvCOMP library API usage alongside our performance benchmarks.

More information can be found about the examples [here](examples/) and about the benchmarks [here](benchmarks/)
